# Report a security vulnerability

Please do not open GitHub issues or pull requests to address security vulnerabilities - this will make the problem immediately visible to everyone, including malicious actors. 

To report a security vulnerability, email opensource@telicent.io 

To help us triage and action your report quickly, please include the following in your report:

- Product Name
- Description of the vulnerability
- Impact of vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce

We strongly encourage you to report one plain-text, unencrypted, email for each vulnerability that you wish to report. 

Avoid image, video, HTML or PDF attachments. We may ask you to resubmit your report.
